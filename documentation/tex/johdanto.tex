Speech is the most important form of human communication. This is why it's not
suprising that humans have been developing machines to produce artificial speech
as far back as 18th century~\cite{SchroederManfredR1993Abho}. Such machines
allow communication in situations where one of the participants is not
able to produce audible speech for the rest. This might be because of physical
distance, physiolocigal inability or the speaker might not be a human in the
first place. Modern artificial speech solutions are most often created as
computer programs called text to speech applications. 

% Is physiolocigal inability appropriate phrase
% Check if TTS applications is right


This study is done in concurrency to a larger project of
deep speaking avatar which seeks to create a human like digital avatar, that anyone
can interact with by speaking to. Goal of this study is to produce a
text to speech system for that avatar by using state of the art deep learning
methods. The system implements a pretrained text to speech neural network called
Tacotron2~\cite{shen2018natural}.

The structure of this thesis is as follows.
